	<p>I completed my undergraduate education in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science from NIT Trichy. If you are interested in my research, please take a look at my most recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13782"> paper</a> on synthesizing dynamically feasible trajectories by
		design for applications in underactuated robotics. For more details about me, please take a look at my <a href="/cv/Anusha_Srikanthan.pdf"> CV</a> or my <a href="/Publications/"> CV</a> to get to know my work better. Connect with me on LinkedIn to talk more! </p>
