Anusha Srikanthan is a 5th year PhD candidate in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania's GRASP Lab, jointly advised by Dr. Nikolai Matni and Dr. Vijay Kumar. Her research focuses on fundamental problems at the intersection of control theory, optimization, and robotics—with emphasis on guaranteeing safety and feasibility in autonomous systems. She is particularly interested in designing layered control architectures that provide rigorous mathematical guarantees while remaining practically applicable to real robotic platforms. Her work spans trajectory optimization for nonlinear systems, safe navigation algorithms, and the integration of learning with control. She previously earned her M.S. in Robotics at Georgia Tech, where she worked on multi-agent task allocation and learning from demonstrations. She received the Excellent Paper Award at IROS 2021 for her work on resilient task allocation for heterogeneous robots. Outside of research, Anusha is a trained classical dancer and served as dance team lead during her undergraduate years at NIT Trichy, India.
